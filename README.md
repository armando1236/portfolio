# portfolio

This is a website of my portfolio. It's still a work in progress so all of the pictures are place holders. As I complete more assignments, I'll replace the images. I added a navigation bar that included links to my work, contact information, information about myself, and my resume. I tried to keep the site clean and easy to navigate.
